# Citewalk — The European Social Network

> Citewalk is a social network where ideas connect and grow.
> Post about what you know, follow topics you care about, and explore how ideas build on each other — transparently, without algorithms.
> Independent, EU-hosted, and sustainably funded by its community.

## What is Citewalk?

Citewalk is a social network where ideas connect and grow. It's a text-first platform built around topics, citations, and how ideas build on each other. Instead of optimizing for outrage and engagement, Citewalk rewards substance: your visibility grows when people reference and cite your work. Posts connect through citation chains, creating a transparent knowledge graph where you can see how ideas evolve and build on each other.

## Key Differentiators

- **No Algorithm**: Feeds are chronological. No black-box sorting, no engagement manipulation.
- **Citation-Based Reputation**: Users link concepts ([[Topic]]) or posts ([[post:uuid]]) directly in text. Your credibility grows through references, not likes.
- **Private Metrics**: Like counts are private to the author. Public metrics are "Quotes" and "References".
- **European & Independent**: 100% EU-hosted (Hetzner, Germany). GDPR compliant. No venture capital, no ads.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Full data export, RSS feeds for every profile. No lock-in, ever.
- **Ad-Free & Tracking-Free**: No advertising, no user tracking, no data sales.
- **Sustainably Funded**: Free to use, sustained by optional Citewalk Pro subscriptions and community support. No ads, no data sales — a business built on honest value exchange.

## Who is it for?

Citewalk is for writers, thinkers, researchers, journalists, and anyone who wants to share ideas and see them connect and grow. It is designed for people who want their ideas to be discoverable on merit — where posts build on each other through citations, creating transparent chains of thought that show how knowledge evolves.

## How it Works

1. **Write**: Compose long-form or short-form posts with a rich text editor. Cite sources, link topics, reference other posts. Your ideas become part of a growing knowledge network.
2. **Connect**: Follow people and topics. Your feed shows what you follow, chronologically. See how ideas connect and build on each other.
3. **Discover**: Browse topics, follow citation trails, explore how ideas grow through transparent citation chains.
4. **Grow**: Your reputation is built through the quality and citability of your writing. When others cite your work, your ideas spread and connect with new audiences.
