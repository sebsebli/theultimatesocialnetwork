    body: `# The Case for Walkable Cities

We need to rethink how we build our cities. For too long, we've prioritized cars over people.

## Why Walkability Matters

[[Urbanism]] isn't just about aesthetics; it's about health, community, and sustainability. When cities are designed for walking, people are healthier, local businesses thrive, and pollution decreases.

> "A city is more than a place in space, it is a drama in time." - Patrick Geddes

We should look at examples like **Amsterdam** and **Copenhagen** for inspiration.

    body: `# AI and the Future of Work

The rapid advancement of [[AI]] is raising important questions about the future of employment.

## Automation vs. Augmentation

Will robots take our jobs? Or will they help us do them better? I believe in the latter. We need to focus on **human-AI collaboration**.

[[Technology]] should serve humanity, not replace it. The ethical implications of [[AI]] are vast and complex.

    body: `# The Industrial Revolution: A Retrospective

Looking back at the 19th century, we see a world in rapid transition. [[History]] teaches us that periods of great change are often accompanied by great upheaval.

The shift from agrarian societies to industrial powerhouses fundamentally changed human existence.

*   Urbanization exploded.
*   Labor movements began.
*   Standard of living eventually rose, but at a cost.

We are living through a similar shift today with the digital revolution.

    body: `# Starting a Food Forest

I'm transforming my lawn into a [[Permaculture]] paradise. It's easier than you think!

## The Layers

1.  **Canopy:** Large fruit and nut trees.
2.  **Understory:** Smaller fruit trees.
3.  **Shrub Layer:** Berries!
4.  **Herbaceous Layer:** Comfrey, herbs.
5.  **Ground Cover:** Strawberries, clover.
6.  **Rhizosphere:** Root vegetables.
7.  **Vines:** Grapes, kiwi.

It's amazing how much food you can grow in a small space. [[Gardening]] is resistance.

    body: `# The Illusion of Multitasking

Our brains are not wired to multitask. [[Cognitive Science]] shows that what we call multitasking is actually rapid task-switching, and it comes with a high cognitive cost.

> "To do two things at once is to do neither." - Publilius Syrus

## The Switch Cost

Every time you switch tasks, you lose focus and efficiency. It takes time to get back into the "flow".

We need to embrace **deep work** and single-tasking. [[Productivity]] is about focus, not busyness.

Baking bread is chemistry you can eat. 🍞

The magic of [[Baking]] lies in fermentation. Wild yeast and bacteria work together to create flavor and texture.

## Key Variables

*   **Hydration:** The ratio of water to flour.
*   **Temperature:** Controls fermentation speed.
*   **Time:** Flavor develops over time.

Don't be afraid to experiment!

In an age of constant distraction, attention is a scarce resource. [[Minimalism]] helps us strip away the noise and focus on what matters.

We are the product in the attention economy. It's time to opt out.

*   Turn off notifications.
*   Delete distracting apps.
*   Spend time in nature.

Welcome to the world of sound synthesis! [[Music]] production has never been more accessible.

## Types of Synthesis

*   **Subtractive:** Start with a rich waveform and filter it down. (Moog)
*   **Additive:** Build sound by adding sine waves.
*   **FM:** Modulate the frequency of one oscillator with another. (DX7)

It's all about shaping the sound wave.

[[Literature]] builds empathy. It allows us to live a thousand lives.

When we read a novel, we simulate social experiences. We learn to understand perspectives different from our own.

I just finished a 3-day trip along the coast. The views were incredible. 🌊

[[Cycling]] is the best way to travel. You're fast enough to see a lot, but slow enough to appreciate the details.

## Gear List

*   Gravel bike
*   Tent
*   Sleeping bag
*   Coffee kit (essential!)

Highly recommend this route for anyone interested in [[Travel]] and adventure.

    body: `# Brutalist Architecture: Ugly or Misunderstood?

[[Architecture]] is subjective, but few styles are as polarizing as Brutalism.

## Raw Concrete

The term comes from *béton brut* (raw concrete). It's honest, functional, and imposing.

Some see it as cold and dystopian. I see it as sculpturally powerful and socially ambitious.

What do you think?

CRISPR technology is a game changer. We can now edit DNA with unprecedented precision.

## The Promise and Peril

*   **Curing diseases:** We could eliminate genetic disorders.
*   **Designer babies:** Should we enhance human traits?

[[Ethics]] must guide [[Science]]. Just because we *can* do something doesn't mean we *should*.

Don't throw away your kitchen scraps! Turn them into black gold.

[[Gardening]] starts with healthy soil.

## Greens vs. Browns

*   **Greens:** Nitrogen (scraps, grass clippings).
*   **Browns:** Carbon (leaves, paper, cardboard).

Aim for a balance. Your plants will thank you.

When you're not focusing on a task, your brain is still active. This is the **Default Mode Network (DMN)**.

It's involved in daydreaming, self-reflection, and thinking about others.

[[Cognitive Science]] suggests that an overactive DMN is linked to anxiety and depression. Meditation can help quiet it.
